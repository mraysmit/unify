         *    - Default load factor (0.75) provides a good balance between space efficiency and performance
         *    - Lower load factor (e.g., 0.5) reduces collision probability but increases memory usage
         *    - Higher load factor (e.g., 0.9) reduces memory usage but increases collision probability
         * 
         * 3. Concurrency Level (for Java 7 and earlier):
         *    - Set concurrency level to the estimated number of threads that will concurrently modify the map
         *    - In Java 8+, ConcurrentHashMap dynamically adjusts the concurrency level
         * 
         * 4. Implementation Example:
         *    ```java
         *    // For a map expected to hold 100 elements with 8 concurrent threads
         *    Map<String, String> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>(134, 0.75f);
         *    ```
         * 
         * 5. Utility Method Approach:
         *    ```java
         *    private <K, V> ConcurrentHashMap<K, V> createSizedConcurrentMap(int expectedSize) {
         *        return new ConcurrentHashMap<>((int)(expectedSize / 0.75) + 1, 0.75f);
         *    }
         *    ```

         * Recommendations for sizing CopyOnWriteArrayList:
         * 
         * 1. Initial Capacity:
         *    - CopyOnWriteArrayList doesn't have a constructor with initial capacity
         *    - To initialize with a specific capacity, create an ArrayList with the desired capacity
         *      and pass it to the CopyOnWriteArrayList constructor
         *    - This approach pre-allocates memory but doesn't affect the size of the list
         * 
         * 2. Implementation Example:
         *    ```java
         *    // For a list expected to hold 100 elements
         *    List<String> initialList = new ArrayList<>(100);
         *    List<String> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>(initialList);
         *    ```
         * 
         * 3. Considerations:
         *    - CopyOnWriteArrayList creates a new copy of the underlying array for every modification
         *    - Initial capacity doesn't reduce this overhead for modifications
         *    - Only use CopyOnWriteArrayList for read-heavy scenarios with rare modifications
         *    - For write-heavy scenarios, consider other concurrent collections

        /**
         * General recommendations for sizing concurrent collections:
         * 
         * 1. Estimate Expected Size:
         *    - Analyze your data to estimate the expected number of elements
         *    - Consider growth patterns and peak usage scenarios
         *    - When in doubt, slightly overestimate to reduce resizing operations
         * 
         * 2. Monitor and Adjust:
         *    - Use profiling tools to monitor collection performance
         *    - Adjust sizing parameters based on actual usage patterns
         *    - Look for signs of frequent resizing or high contention
         * 
         * 3. Batch Operations:
         *    - Group related operations to reduce contention
         *    - Pre-size collections before batch insertions
         *    - Consider using bulk operations where available
         * 
         * 4. Documentation:
         *    - Document sizing decisions and assumptions
         *    - Include expected usage patterns in comments
         *    - Explain the rationale for specific sizing parameters

        /**
         * Overall recommendations for the project:
         * 
         * 1. For single-threaded access (current usage):
         *    - The current collection choices are generally appropriate for their use cases.
         *    - LinkedHashMap is used appropriately where order matters.
         *    - ArrayList is used appropriately for lists with frequent random access.
         *    - HashMap is used appropriately for maps with no ordering requirements.
         * 
         * 2. For potential multi-threaded access:
         *    - Replace HashMap with ConcurrentHashMap for thread safety.
         *    - Replace ArrayList with CopyOnWriteArrayList for read-heavy scenarios.
         *    - Replace ArrayList with ConcurrentLinkedDeque for balanced read-write scenarios.
         *    - Replace LinkedHashMap with ConcurrentHashMap and custom ordering logic if order matters.
         * 
         * 3. Performance optimizations:
         *    - Specify initial capacity for collections when size is known in advance.
         *    - Use proper sizing strategies for concurrent collections to reduce resizing operations.
         *    - Consider using specialized collections for specific use cases (e.g., EnumMap for enum keys).
         *    - Use immutable collections for read-only data.
         * 
         * 4. Memory optimizations:
         *    - Use primitive collections where appropriate to reduce memory footprint.
         *    - Consider using compact data structures for large datasets.
         *    - Balance between memory usage and performance when choosing load factors.
